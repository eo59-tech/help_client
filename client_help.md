To download the data from the Corner Reflectors on your site, click the cA button for the Ascending data, or cD for the Descending data in CSV or GeoJSON format.

Your browser may ask for permission prior to downloading the data on your device.

Some sites have data from two different satellites - Sentinel-1 and COSMO-Skymed. In this case, data from Sentinel-1 is indicated as SA or SD, while data from COSMO-Skymed is shown as CA or CD.

Using the polygon button feature you can select multiple points by creating a polygon around the desired points. Activate the polygon button in the top right of your screen (square shape with dots in the corners) and create a polygon on the map by clicking around the desired points. End the selection by clicking on the first point you started the shape with.

You can observe the points' displacement separately, as well as see their averaged cumulative deformation.

The selections can be cleared with the bin button.

An area can be "locked" by clicking anywhere else on the map. The area's borders will turn blue and it cannot be cleared with the bin button. To make it active again, just click on the shape again.

Interpreting the data
---------------------

Corner reflectors are represented by the white T-shapes and either cA or cD on the legend.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c94e830840b162c4ae861cd/2199c054-2cc4-4c3e-86f4-99747eb6cb07/Picture+34.jpg)

On a single orbit site (Ascending or Descending only), the deformation points are represented by dots.

![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c94e830840b162c4ae861cd/41f7ae6e-bc51-4f82-8aa1-5582e872b46e/Picture+35.jpg)

On a site that has both orbits, Ascending and Descending, the deformation points are displayed with arrows, which represent the direction the satellite is looking.

The color of the dots or arrows represent the direction of the deformation, and is explained by the legend, where red stands for motion away from the satellite, blue represents motion toward it and green means the area is averaging no motion trend in either direction. Green does not indicate a lack of motion, season variability and elastic events are visible in the time series.

Be cautious when interpreting motion directions using the arrows. They are most helpful when you keep in mind, they are indicating the direction the satellite is looking, not the necessarily the direction of motion. When the arrow is red, this indicates that the motion average along the time series is away from the satellite in the direction of the arrow. When the arrow is blue, this indicates that the motion average along the time series is towards the satellite. This means that the motion is trending in the opposite direction than the arrow is pointing.
